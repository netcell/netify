This simple tool is written using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), tested on Windows 10 and Mac OSX El Capitan, but should works with most versions of Windows and Mac OSX that support notification.

The tool checks with `ping` command of the system and notifies when you lose internet connection, when you get it back and when the connection quality is low.

**Support translation:** English and Vietnamese. Translations are welcome. Please look into `language.js` file for more information and create a PR if you want to contribute a translation.
